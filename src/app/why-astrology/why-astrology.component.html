      <h1>Astrology: A Predictive Science</h1>
      <p>Astrology is a predictive science with its own sets of methods, claims, and findings that have forever inspired and allowed people insights into different aspects of their life. Astrology, with its wows and hows, is contentful and approving enough to make people believers. Thankfully, it continues to do so despite the world shifting beliefs.</p>
      
      <h2>The Study of Cosmic Objects</h2>
      <p>Astrology is the study of different cosmic objects, usually stars and planets, that have an effect on people's lives. While there are 8 planets in the solar system, astrology considers 9 planets, also called Navagrahas. Interestingly, Earth is not counted among these nine planets.</p>
      
      <h2>The 9 Planets in Astrology</h2>
      <p>The 9 planets in astrology are Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), Rahu (north node of the moon), and Ketu (south node of the moon).</p>
      
      <h2>Positive and Negative Planets</h2>
      <p>Some planets bring positivity to life, while others have a negative influence. Rahu and Ketu, for example, are often associated with challenges. However, the impact of a planet depends on the house it occupies in a person's Kundli.</p>
      
      <h2>The 12 Houses in Kundli</h2>
      <p>An astrologer would explain the importance of the 12 houses in Kundli, each representing different aspects of life. For example, the first house represents self and personality, while the fifth house (Putra Bhava) governs creativity, joy, and romance.</p>
      
      <h2>Elements of Astrology</h2>
      <p>Astrology encompasses various elements, including Moon signs, numerology, tarot reading, and more.</p>
